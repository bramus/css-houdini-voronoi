## Usage

### 1. Getting `css-houdini-voronoi`

#### Using a pre-built hosted version

The easiest way to get `css-houdini-voronoi` is to use the prebuilt version through UNPKG. Just skip ahead to step 2 in that case.

#### Installing it Locally

You can install the `css-houdini-voronoi` locally using NPM.

```bash
npm install css-houdini-voronoi
```

Alternatively you can clone [the `css-houdini-voronoi` repo](https://github.com/bramus/css-houdini-voronoi/) and after manually build the project:

```bash
cd css-houdini-voronoi
npm install
npm run build
```

You'll find the built file in the `./dist` folder.

### 2. Loading `css-houdini-voronoi`

To include it you must loads the module in the given JavaScript file and add it to the Paint Worklet.

If you want to use the UNPKG hosted version of `css-houdini-voronoi`, use `https://unpkg.com/css-houdini-voronoi/dist/worklet.js` as the `moduleURL`.

```js
if ('paintWorklet' in CSS) {
    CSS.paintWorklet.addModule('https://unpkg.com/css-houdini-voronoi/dist/worklet.js');
}
```

If you've installed `css-houdini-voronoi` using NPM or have manually built it, refer to its url:

```js
if ('paintWorklet' in CSS) {
    CSS.paintWorklet.addModule('url/to/worklet.js');
}
```

#### A note on older browsers

To add support for [browsers that don't speak Houdini](https://ishoudinireadyyet.com/), you can include the [css-paint-polyfill](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/css-paint-polyfill) before loading the Worklet.

```html
<script>
(async function() {
    if (CSS['paintWorklet'] === undefined) {
        await import('https://unpkg.com/css-paint-polyfill');
    }

    CSS.paintWorklet.addModule('https://unpkg.com/css-houdini-voronoi/dist/worklet.js');
})()
</script>
```

### 3. Applying `css-houdini-voronoi`

To use Voronoi Paint Worklet you need to set the `background-image` property to `paint(voronoi)`

```css
.element {
    background-image: paint(voronoi);
}
```

## Configuration

You can tweak the appearance of the Cicles Paint Worklet by setting some CSS Custom Properties

_ðŸ’¡ The Worklet provides default values so defining them is not required_

```css
.element {
    --voronoi-number-of-cells: 100;
    --voronoi-margin: 5%;
    --voronoi-line-color: #000;
    --voronoi-line-width: 4;

    background-image: paint(voronoi);
}
```

| property | description | default value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| --voronoi-number-of-cells | **Number of cells**, (integer) | `25` |
| --voronoi-margin | **Margin to keep from edges**, as a percentage (0% â€“ 50%). _Set to a negative value to create a zoom effect_ | `0%` |
| --voronoi-line-color | **Line Color** | `#000` |
| --voronoi-line-width | **Line Width**, in pixels  | `3` |

## Animation

To properly animate the Custom Properties you need to register them. Include this CSS Snippet to do so:

```css
@property --voronoi-number-of-cells {
    syntax: "<integer>";
    initial-value: 25;
    inherits: false;
}
@property --voronoi-margin {
    syntax: "<percentage>";
    initial-value: 0%;
    inherits: false;
}
@property --voronoi-line-color {
    syntax: "<color>";
    initial-value: #000;
    inherits: false;
}
@property --voronoi-line-width {
    syntax: "<integer>";
    initial-value: 5;
    inherits: false;
}
```

## Demo / Development
